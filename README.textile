h1. GeoPaste - Edit and Share GeoJSON Features

WORK IN PROGRESS

This intends to allow the sharing of GeoJSON features in a way inspired by @gist.github.com@, but also store all GeoJSON in a replicable GeoCouch instance.


h3. Installation/Getting it Running locally

Super easy. First, get yourself a Couch: 

"http://www.couchone.com/get":http://www.couchone.com/get

Next, clone or fork action:

@git clone git://github.com/maxogden/geopaste.git@
    
Then edit your DB URL in your .couchapprc
    
@cd geopaste@
@open .couchapprc@
    
You should make the @"default"@ URL map to your couch including your username and password. By default, CouchDB is in admin party mode (meaning you dont need a user/pass and every one is an admin) so you can just get rid of the 'admin:admin' in the default URL or add an admin/admin user to your CouchDB instance:

<pre><code>{ "env": { "default": { "db": "http://admin:admin@127.0.0.1:5984/my_couchapp_db" } } }</code></pre>

Then, its easy-peasy:

@couchapp push@
